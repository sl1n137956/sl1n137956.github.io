### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, Lab 2 was a favorite since it was my first serious interaction with programming. I loved building basic inputs and outputs that allowed the software to respond based on the user's input. This lab got me enthusiastic about what more I could do with code and made me feel better prepared for future experiments. It was a fantastic starting place for learning more about how programming works.

* Lab 3
    
    Lab 3, Lab 3 was another favorite since it was my first experience learning how to compute something useful like the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). I loved using coding formulas to calculate BMR for men and women depending on weight, height, and age. This lab was quite intriguing to observe how different factors affected the results, and it felt great to build code that might be utilized in real-world situations. It was a useful method for understanding the immediate influence of programming on common situations.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, Lab 9 was another favorite since it offered the enjoyable aspect of guessing a hidden number. I loved configuring the application to accept a secret number and prompting the user to guess. This guessing game feature made the lab more exciting and dynamic, providing me with personal experience with how programming can be utilized to develop basic yet fun games. It was an excellent method to learn coding while still having fun.
